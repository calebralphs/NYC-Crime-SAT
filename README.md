# NYC-Crime-SAT

The repository contains the material submissions for the final research project for WPI's MA 463X course: 
Data Analytics and Statistical Learning. 

This case study was completed to research and evaluate possible relationships between standardized test
scores results, more precisely the SATs, and the crime rates around a determined school
radius. This is a problem that not only involve data analysis but the social implications
associated with education access and criminality. If relationship is proven, a diagnosis will be
provided in order to minimize the public security issues surrounding the pre-established regions.
Moreover, it provides precedent for students to boost their scholarly work due to projections
linked to their respective futures.
